# secret_message_app
This simple app allows you to create a encrypted message that you can send to your friends via a link.

1. When a user first comes to the Web application, they are shown a text input that prompts them to enter a secret message.
2. Once the user enters the secret message and clicks create, it gets encoded to a base64 ASCII string and they are then given a link to share with their friends 
3. The link can then be pasted into a new browser tab where it well be decoded, showing the original message 
4. The new link will also prompt the friend to create their own secret message that can also be encrypted and sent to others
